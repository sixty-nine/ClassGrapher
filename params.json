{"name":"ClassGrapher","tagline":"Generate a basic class diagram in GraphViz DOT format from PHP files","body":"Class Grapher [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sixty-nine/ClassGrapher.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sixty-nine/ClassGrapher)\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis code is distributed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nThis application will generate a basic class diagram in GraphViz DOT format from\r\nthe PHP files found in the path given as parameter.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is not to get an exact and detailed UML view, but rather\r\nto provide the programmer with a quick way to figure out how some code is structured.\r\n\r\nThe grapher does not use PHP reflection so that there is no need to actually instanciate\r\nthe classes that will be shown in the diagram. It means you can graph any set of PHP\r\nfiles, even if there are missing dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe grapher supports namespaced PHP 5.3. However, to reduce the width of the rendered \r\ngraph, the full namespaces are not shown in the diagram. This can easily be changed in\r\nthe GraphVizBuilder::addNode method.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis code uses external components that will be installed with composer.\r\n\r\n#### Download composer\r\n\r\nSee http://packagist.org/\r\n\r\nYou have to put the composer.phar file in the root directory of the project.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd project_dir # The folder where you have put the ClassGrapher files\r\nwget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar\r\nchmod +x composer.phar\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Install the vendors\r\n\r\n```\r\n./composer.phar install\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAssumed you have ImageMagick installed you can run the following command to generate\r\na class diagram of the class grapher code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp devtools graph src/ | dot -T png | display\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the ```--groups``` option to group the classes by namespace and the ```--noedges``` option to not display relations between the classes.\r\n\r\nRunning the tests\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\nphpunit -c tests/\r\n```","google":"UA-66374011-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
